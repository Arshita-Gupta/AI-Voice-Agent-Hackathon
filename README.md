## AI Voice Agent – Hackathon Project

This project is an AI-based voice calling agent that can talk to people over phone calls.

The idea is to let an AI handle real conversations for things like government services, customer support, and helplines, instead of using old-style IVR systems.  
The system was built in a modular way, where each team member worked on one important part of the whole pipeline.

### What the system does

- Answers phone calls automatically  
- Understands Hindi and English  
- Talks back using AI-generated voice  
- Asks for consent before continuing  
- Keeps track of suspicious or repeated calls

### Project structure

Each folder in this repository represents one core part of the system:

- Voice & calling  
- Speech processing  
- AI conversation  
- Ethics and consent  
- Trust and fraud detection  

All of these parts can be connected to form a complete AI voice agent.
